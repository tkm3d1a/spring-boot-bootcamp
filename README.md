# Spring Boot Bootcamp

This will be where I place completed lessons.  Each one will be it's own folder as they are starting out as a structured maven project.  I want to keep this as a centralized repo for each completed item/lesson/workbook/challenge so that is how this will be structured.  It may get messy/large but I will highlight anything key or cool in this core readme file.

# Repo structure

- [Hello-spring](./hello-spring/)
  - First Maven project
  - Learned how to package and set up custom ports as well as get a base index to show
- [painting](./painting/)
  - Chalenge 1 result
  - Just simple no tutorial/guidance display of some provided images
